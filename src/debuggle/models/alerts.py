üö® Hospital Alert System Department - Models for Emergency Notifications

This is the emergency alert system of our hospital! Just like how a real hospital
has different levels of emergency alerts (Code Blue, Code Red, etc.) and various 
ways to notify staff (PA system, pagers, mobile alerts), we have a sophisticated
alert system for code emergencies.

Think of this like the hospital's emergency response system:
- AlertRuleRequest: Setting up new emergency protocols
- AlertResponse: Details of an actual emergency incident
- AlertStatsResponse: Performance report of the alert system

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like a school's emergency alert system:
1. Set up rules for different emergencies (fire, tornado, lockdown)
2. Choose how to notify people (PA, text, email)
3. Track when alerts happen and how people respond
4. Review system performance to improve response times
