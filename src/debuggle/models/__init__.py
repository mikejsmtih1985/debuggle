"""
üè• Hospital Medical Forms Directory - All Official Medical Forms in One Place!

This is like the hospital's main forms directory where you can find all the official
medical forms, charts, and documentation needed throughout the hospital. Instead of
running around to different departments, everything is organized here for easy access.

Think of this like a hospital's forms central station:
- Common forms used everywhere (intake forms, consent forms)
- Department-specific forms (lab reports, surgical notes)
- Administrative forms (billing, insurance)
- Emergency forms (alert reports, triage sheets)

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like the school's main office where you can get any form you need:
- Enrollment forms, transcript requests, permission slips
- All organized by category so you know exactly where to look
- Everything officially approved and ready to use
- One-stop shopping for all your paperwork needs!

USAGE EXAMPLES:
    from debuggle.models import AnalyzeRequest, HealthResponse
    from debuggle.models.analysis import AnalyzeOptions
    from debuggle.models.alerts import AlertRuleRequest
