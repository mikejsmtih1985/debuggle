"""üìã MEDICAL FORMS DEPARTMENT - Data Models Registry! üìã

This is like the central filing cabinet where all our medical forms
(data models) are organized and catalogued. Instead of having one
giant messy drawer with all forms mixed together, we now have
organized filing sections for different types of forms.

üè• DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATION:
- analysis.py: Error diagnosis forms
- upload.py: File processing forms  
- dashboard.py: Analytics and metrics forms
- realtime.py: Live monitoring forms
- alerts.py: Emergency notification forms
- ingestion.py: Batch processing forms
- common.py: Shared form templates and enums

This makes it easy for different hospital departments to find
exactly the forms they need without searching through everything!

# Import all models for easy access
# This is like having a master directory that points to all departments

# Currently empty - will be populated as we move models from the monolithic models.py
# to the organized departmental structure
