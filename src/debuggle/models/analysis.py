üî¨ Medical Analysis Department - Models for Diagnostic Reports

This is the medical analysis department of our hospital! Just like how a real hospital
has different labs for blood work, X-rays, and MRIs, we have different types of analysis
models for examining code problems.

Think of this like the medical forms used by different hospital departments:
- AnalyzeOptions: The checkboxes on a lab order form
- AnalyzeRequest: The initial patient complaint form
- AnalyzeMetadata: The technical details on a lab report
- AnalyzeResponse: The complete diagnostic report

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like going to the doctor when you're sick:
1. You fill out a form describing your symptoms (AnalyzeRequest)
2. Doctor asks what kind of tests you want (AnalyzeOptions)
3. Lab runs the tests and records technical details (AnalyzeMetadata)
4. Doctor gives you the complete results and explanation (AnalyzeResponse)
