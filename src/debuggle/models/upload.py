üì§ File Upload Department - Models for Medical File Processing

This is the file upload department of our hospital! Just like how a hospital
processes different types of medical documents (X-rays, lab reports, patient files),
we process different types of code files and transform them into clean diagnostic reports.

Think of this like the medical records department:
- FileUploadMetadata: The processing receipt and technical details
- FileUploadResponse: The complete processed file with diagnosis

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like taking your film to get developed at a photo lab:
1. You drop off a roll of film (upload a log file)
2. Lab processes it and records technical details (FileUploadMetadata)
3. You get back developed photos with information sheet (FileUploadResponse)

    üìä FILE PROCESSING RECEIPT - Technical Details About Your Upload
    
    This is like the receipt you get when you drop off your dry cleaning -
    it tells you exactly what was processed, when it was done, and any
    special notes about the service.
    
    üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
    Think of this like getting a report card for your file upload:
    - filename: "math_homework.py" (what you called your file)
    - file_size: "5,432 bytes" (how big your file was)
    - lines: "247 lines" (how much content it had)
    - language_detected: "Python" (what type of code it was)
    - processing_time_ms: "1,500ms" (how long it took to process)
    - truncated: "Had to cut it short due to size" (if we couldn't process it all)

    üì¶ FILE ANALYSIS DELIVERY - Your Processed File is Ready!
    
    This is like getting your developed photos back from the photo lab,
    but instead of photos, you're getting back your analyzed and cleaned-up
    error logs with explanations and insights.

    Think of this like getting your graded project back from the teacher,
    complete with corrections, feedback, category grades, and processing notes.
