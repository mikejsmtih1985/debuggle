üíæ Hospital Medical Records Department - Models for Log Storage & Search

This is the medical records and search department of our hospital! Just like how a 
real hospital maintains comprehensive patient records, search systems, and data retention
policies, we maintain sophisticated storage and search capabilities for code diagnostics.

Think of this like the hospital's medical records system:
- SearchRequest: Looking up patient records with specific criteria
- LogStorageRequest: Filing new medical reports in permanent records
- RetentionPolicyRequest: Setting policies for how long to keep different types of records

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like a school's student records system:
1. Search: Find student files matching specific criteria (grades, subjects, dates)
2. Storage: File new test results and reports in permanent records
3. Retention: Decide how long to keep different types of student records
4. Organization: Keep everything organized so it can be found quickly later
