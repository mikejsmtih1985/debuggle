"""
üî¨ Hospital Analysis Department - Error Diagnostic Routes

This is the analysis department of our hospital! Just like how a real hospital's
diagnostic department handles lab tests, X-rays, and medical analysis, this module
handles all error analysis and diagnostic endpoints.

Think of this like the hospital's diagnostic center:
- /analyze: Basic error analysis (like a routine blood test)
- /analyze-with-context: Advanced analysis with additional context (like a full MRI scan)

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like a school's tutoring center where students bring their homework problems:
1. Student submits their coding problem (error log)
2. Tutor analyzes the problem and explains what's wrong
3. Student gets back explained solution with helpful hints
4. System keeps track of common problems to help future students

NOTE: This is the modular route structure. The route implementations will be
moved here from main.py during the refactoring process.

# TODO: Route definitions will be moved here from main.py

# the modular structure.

# The following routes will be implemented:
# - POST /analyze: Main error analysis endpoint
# - POST /analyze-with-context: Advanced contextual analysis endpoint
