üìä Hospital Dashboard Department - Analytics & Performance Routes

This is the analytics and dashboard department of our hospital! Just like how a real 
hospital has dashboards showing patient statistics, bed occupancy, and performance metrics,
this module handles all analytics and dashboard-related endpoints.

Think of this like the hospital's main control center:
- /analytics: System performance statistics
- /dashboards/*: Custom dashboard management  
- /metrics/*: System health and performance metrics

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like a school's administrative dashboard that shows:
1. How many students are in each grade (error counts by type)
2. Which subjects are most challenging (programming languages with errors)  
3. Attendance patterns over time (error trends)
4. Most popular activities (search terms and usage patterns)

NOTE: This is the modular route structure. The route implementations will be
moved here from main.py during the refactoring process.
