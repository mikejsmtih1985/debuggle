üíæ Hospital Medical Records Department - Storage & Search Routes

This is the medical records and search department of our hospital! Just like how a 
real hospital maintains comprehensive patient records, search systems, and data retention
policies, this module handles all storage, search, and data management endpoints.

Think of this like the hospital's medical records system:
- /search: Look up stored logs with specific criteria
- /retention/*: Manage data retention policies

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like a school's student records system:
1. Search: Find student files matching specific criteria (grades, subjects, dates)
2. Storage: File new test results and reports in permanent records
3. Retention: Decide how long to keep different types of student records
4. Organization: Keep everything organized so it can be found quickly later

NOTE: This is the modular route structure. The route implementations will be
moved here from main.py during the refactoring process.

# TODO: Route definitions will be moved here from main.py

# The following routes will be implemented:
# - POST /search: Advanced log search
# - POST /retention/policy: Create retention policy
# - POST /retention/execute: Execute retention cleanup
