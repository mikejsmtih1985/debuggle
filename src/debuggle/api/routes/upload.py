üì§ Hospital File Upload Department - Medical File Processing Routes

This is the file upload department of our hospital! Just like how a real hospital
processes different types of medical documents (lab reports, X-rays, patient files),
this module handles uploading and processing different types of log files.

Think of this like the hospital's medical records intake:
- /upload-log: Upload log files for analysis (like bringing medical records from another hospital)

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like a school's document submission center where students can:
1. Upload their programming assignment files that have errors
2. System processes the files and finds the problems
3. Students get back detailed feedback on what went wrong
4. Files are kept on record for progress tracking

NOTE: This is the modular route structure. The route implementations will be
moved here from main.py during the refactoring process.

# TODO: Route definitions will be moved here from main.py

# The following routes will be implemented:
# - POST /upload-log: File upload and analysis endpoint
