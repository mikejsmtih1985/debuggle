üì° DEBUGGLE LIVE BROADCAST STATION - Real-Time Error Monitoring! üì°

Think of this file as a TV news station that broadcasts breaking news about
errors as they happen! Just like how news stations have reporters, camera crews,
and broadcast equipment, this module has everything needed to capture and
broadcast error "news" in real-time.

üéØ WHAT THIS MODULE DOES:
This is the "live streaming" system for Debuggle. When errors happen anywhere
in the system, this module immediately tells all connected users about it,
like a news alert system for programming problems!

üì∫ THE NEWS STATION ANALOGY:
- ConnectionManager: Like the broadcast control room that manages all TV channels
- ErrorEvent: Like a news story with headline, details, and timestamp
- RealtimeErrorMonitor: Like the news director who decides what to broadcast
- WebSocket connections: Like individual TV channels going to different homes

üîÑ HOW REAL-TIME MONITORING WORKS:
1. Something goes wrong in the system (like a "breaking news" event)
2. We create an ErrorEvent (like writing a news story)
3. The RealtimeErrorMonitor decides if it should be broadcast
4. The ConnectionManager sends it to all connected users (like broadcasting)
5. Users see the error immediately in their browsers (like watching live TV)

Real-world analogy: This is like having a security system that immediately
sends alerts to your phone when something happens at your house - no waiting,
no delays, you know about problems as soon as they occur!
