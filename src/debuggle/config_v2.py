‚öôÔ∏è DEBUGGLE CONTROL CENTER - The Master Settings Dashboard! ‚öôÔ∏è

Think of this file as the "control room" of a spaceship or the settings menu
of your favorite video game! This is where we define ALL the knobs, switches,
and dials that control how Debuggle behaves in different situations.

üéØ WHAT THIS MODULE DOES:
This is the "brain" that remembers how Debuggle should behave. Just like how
you can adjust your phone's brightness, volume, and notifications, this file
lets us adjust Debuggle's behavior for different environments.

üè† THE CONTROL ROOM ANALOGY:
- Environment: Like choosing "Home", "Work", or "Do Not Disturb" mode on your phone
- LogLevel: Like adjusting how much detail you want in notifications
- AnalysisSettings: Like tuning how thorough your spell-checker should be
- APISettings: Like setting speed limits and traffic rules for requests
- SecuritySettings: Like configuring your home security system

üîç HOW CONFIGURATION WORKS:
1. We define what settings are available (like creating a settings menu)
2. We set sensible defaults (like factory settings on a new device)
3. We allow environment variables to override defaults (like user preferences)
4. We validate settings to prevent dangerous configurations (like safety checks)
5. We provide different "profiles" for different situations (dev, test, production)

Real-world analogy: This is like having different profiles on Netflix - 
"Kids Profile" has different rules than "Adult Profile", and "Travel Profile"
might have different download settings than "Home Profile"!
