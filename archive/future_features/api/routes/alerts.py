üö® Hospital Alert System Department - Emergency Notification Routes

This is the emergency alert system of our hospital! Just like how a real hospital
has different levels of emergency alerts (Code Blue, Code Red, etc.) and various 
ways to notify staff (PA system, pagers, mobile alerts), this module handles all
alert and notification endpoints.

Think of this like the hospital's emergency response system:
- /alerts/rules: Manage alert rules and triggers
- /alerts: View and manage active alerts
- /alerts/stats: Alert system performance statistics

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like a school's emergency alert system:
1. Set up rules for different emergencies (fire, tornado, lockdown)
2. Choose how to notify people (PA, text, email)
3. Track when alerts happen and how people respond
4. Review system performance to improve response times

NOTE: This is the modular route structure. The route implementations will be
moved here from main.py during the refactoring process.

# TODO: Route definitions will be moved here from main.py

# the modular structure.

# The following routes will be implemented:
# - POST /alerts/rules: Create new alert rule
# - GET /alerts/rules: List all alert rules
# - DELETE /alerts/rules/{rule_id}: Delete alert rule
# - GET /alerts: List active alerts
# - POST /alerts/{alert_id}/acknowledge: Acknowledge alert
# - POST /alerts/{alert_id}/resolve: Resolve alert
# - GET /alerts/stats: Alert system statistics
