üöÄ Hospital Data Ingestion Department - Large-Scale Processing Routes

This is the data processing center of our hospital! Just like how a large hospital
has specialized systems for handling high volumes of patient data, lab results, and
medical records, this module handles all large-scale log processing endpoints.

Think of this like the hospital's data processing center:
- /ingestion/batch: Submit large batches for processing
- /ingestion/stream/*: Real-time streaming data processing
- /ingestion/jobs/*: Track processing job status

üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
Like a school processing thousands of test papers:
1. Batch processing: Grade all papers together efficiently
2. Streaming: Grade papers as students turn them in
3. Job tracking: Keep track of grading progress and results
4. Statistics: Report on overall grading system performance

NOTE: This is the modular route structure. The route implementations will be
moved here from main.py during the refactoring process.

# üöß FUTURE ROADMAP - Advanced API Routes (Post-Core Implementation)
# =============================================================================
# 
# These routes are planned for future implementation after the core
# CLI functionality is rock-solid. Focus: Ship what works, enhance later.
#
# Planned routes (when there's proven demand):
# - POST /ingestion/batch: Submit batch processing job
# - GET /ingestion/jobs/{job_id}: Get job status  
# - GET /ingestion/stats: Ingestion system statistics
# - POST /ingestion/stream/start: Start streaming session
# - POST /ingestion/stream/{stream_id}/data: Send data to stream
