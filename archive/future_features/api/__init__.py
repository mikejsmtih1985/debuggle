"""🚪 HOSPITAL RECEPTION - API Interface Department! 🚪

This is like the main reception area of our digital hospital where
all patients (API requests) first arrive and get directed to the
right department for their specific needs.

🏥 RECEPTION SERVICES:
- middleware.py: Security and traffic control
- routes/: All medical departments organized by specialty

Like a well-organized hospital, each department handles specific
types of cases, making the whole system more efficient and easier
to navigate for both patients and staff!
