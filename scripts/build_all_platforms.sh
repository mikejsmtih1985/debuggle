# üè≠ DEBUGGLE MULTI-PLATFORM FACTORY - The Universal Assembly Line
# =================================================================
#
# This shell script is like having a sophisticated manufacturing facility
# that can produce the same product (Debuggle) for different markets
# (Windows, Linux, macOS) using automated assembly lines.
#
# üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
# Think of this like a car factory that can build the same car model
# but configure it for different countries:
# - Left-hand drive vs right-hand drive
# - Different electrical systems (110V vs 220V) 
# - Different safety standards and regulations
# - Different languages for the dashboard
#
# This script automates the entire "manufacturing process" so that with
# one command, we can produce ready-to-ship software packages for
# customers using Windows, Mac, or Linux computers.
#
# EDUCATIONAL METAPHORS USED:
# üè≠ Manufacturing & Factory Automation - Build processes like assembly lines
# üîß Industrial Engineering - Optimization and quality control
# üì¶ Shipping & Logistics - Packaging and distribution
# üèóÔ∏è Construction Management - Project coordination and sequencing
#

#
# üéØ SPECIALIZED ASSEMBLY LINE FUNCTION - Platform-specific manufacturing
# =======================================================================
#
# This function is like having a flexible manufacturing station that can
# reconfigure itself to produce the same product for different markets.
# It's the core "assembly line worker" that knows how to build our software
# for specific operating systems.
#
# üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
# Think of this like a skilled technician at a electronics factory who can
# assemble the same smartphone but configure it for different regions:
# - Different power adapters (US vs EU vs UK plugs)
# - Different cellular radio bands for local carriers  
# - Different languages pre-installed
# - Different safety certifications and stickers
#
# The technician follows different procedures depending on which market
# the product is destined for, but the core device is the same.
