# üß™ DEBUGGLE QUALITY ASSURANCE LABORATORY - Comprehensive Testing Facility
# ==========================================================================
#
# This testing script is like having a professional quality assurance
# laboratory that runs comprehensive safety tests, performance evaluations,
# and quality control checks on our software before it goes to customers.
#
# üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
# Think of this like the testing facility where new cars go before being
# sold to the public:
# 1. üîß Safety Tests - Make sure nothing breaks or crashes
# 2. üèÉ Performance Tests - Check that everything runs fast enough
# 3. üîå Integration Tests - Verify all parts work together properly
# 4. ü©∫ Health Checks - Confirm all systems are responding correctly
# 5. üìä Quality Reports - Document what passed and what needs fixing
#
# Just like car manufacturers test every component before shipping,
# we test every piece of Debuggle before users interact with it.
#
# EDUCATIONAL METAPHORS USED:
# üß™ Scientific Laboratory - Controlled testing environment with protocols
# üè• Medical Checkup - Health monitoring and diagnostic procedures
# üè≠ Quality Control - Manufacturing testing and inspection processes
# üî¨ Research Facility - Systematic investigation and validation methods
#

# üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY PROTOCOL - Stop immediately if any test fails
# This is like having an emergency stop button in a factory
set -e

# üì¢ LABORATORY ACTIVATION ANNOUNCEMENT

#
# ‚öôÔ∏è LABORATORY CONFIGURATION - Setting up test environment parameters
# ====================================================================
#
# These settings are like configuring the testing equipment before
# starting experiments - we need to know where to find the system
# being tested and how long to wait for responses.
#
BASE_URL="${BASE_URL:-http://localhost:8000}"  # üåê Address of system under test
TIMEOUT="${TIMEOUT:-30}"                       # ‚è±Ô∏è Maximum wait time for responses

#
# üß™ LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT SETUP - Activating controlled test environment
# ========================================================================
#
# This ensures our tests run in the correct isolated environment,
# like making sure a chemistry experiment uses the right chemicals
# and equipment setup.

#
# ü©∫ SYSTEM HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC - Checking if the patient is responsive
# ===================================================================
#
# This function is like a doctor checking vital signs before starting
# a comprehensive medical examination. We need to confirm the system
# is alive and responding before running detailed tests.
#
# üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
# Think of this like checking if a video game server is online:
# 1. Try to connect to the server (curl -f $BASE_URL/health)
# 2. If it responds, great! We can start testing
# 3. If not, wait a bit and try again (up to 10 times)
# 4. If still no response, something's wrong - report the problem
