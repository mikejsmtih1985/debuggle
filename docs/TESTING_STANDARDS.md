# Testing Standards

## Code Coverage Philosophy

Debuggle maintains **comprehensive test coverage above industry standards** to ensure reliability and quality. Our testing approach focuses on:

### Quality Over Quantity
- **89%+ test coverage** - Well above the industry standard of 70-80%
- **400+ passing tests** - Comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Focus on critical paths** - Prioritizing user-facing functionality and error handling

### Industry Context
- **Most open source projects**: 60-70% coverage
- **Enterprise software**: 70-80% coverage  
- **Critical systems**: 80-90% coverage
- **Debuggle**: 89%+ coverage ✅

### Our Testing Standards
1. **All new features** must include comprehensive tests
2. **Error handling paths** are thoroughly tested
3. **API endpoints** have full integration test coverage
4. **Edge cases** are identified and tested
5. **Real-world scenarios** are validated through examples

### Coverage Areas
- ✅ **API endpoints** - Full integration testing
- ✅ **Core processing logic** - Unit and integration tests
- ✅ **Error handling** - Exception paths validated
- ✅ **Configuration** - Environment and settings validation
- ✅ **File operations** - Upload, processing, and error cases
- ✅ **Language detection** - Multi-language parsing validation

### Continuous Improvement
Our coverage target automatically adjusts based on our achieved coverage, ensuring we never regress in quality while acknowledging that 100% coverage often has diminishing returns.

**Philosophy**: We aim for comprehensive coverage of critical functionality rather than chasing arbitrary percentage targets that may lead to testing trivial code paths at the expense of meaningful validation.
