ðŸŽ¯ DEBUGGLE QUALITY-FIRST COVERAGE STRATEGY

Following Debuggle's educational comment philosophy, this file establishes 
our strategic approach to improving code coverage in a way that actually 
improves software quality rather than just hitting arbitrary numbers.

Think of code coverage like getting a health checkup at the doctor:
- Low coverage = Haven't checked most of your body for problems
- High coverage = Thorough examination that catches issues early
- Quality coverage = Focusing on the most critical health indicators

COVERAGE PHILOSOPHY:
ðŸ“Š Target 85%+ overall coverage (industry best practice for critical software)
ðŸŽ¯ Prioritize core functionality over edge cases
ðŸ§  Focus on business logic and user-facing features
ðŸ”’ Ensure error handling and security paths are tested
âš¡ Test the "happy path" and most common failure scenarios

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
1. Core Analysis Engine (analyzer.py, context.py, processor.py)
2. Storage Layer (database.py, search.py) 
3. User Interface (main.py, dashboard.py)
4. Integration Points (ingestion.py, cloud modules)
5. Utilities and Supporting Code

QUALITY METRICS:
- Line Coverage: 85%+ (measures code execution)  
- Branch Coverage: 80%+ (measures decision paths)
- Function Coverage: 95%+ (measures function calls)
- Integration Coverage: 90%+ (measures module interactions)
