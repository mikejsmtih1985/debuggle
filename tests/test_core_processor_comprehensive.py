Test Suite for Core Processor Module - The Master Detective Investigation Tests! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüß™

Think of this test suite as a rigorous training academy for police detectives.
Just like how rookie cops practice solving mock crimes before handling real cases,
these tests ensure our LogProcessor can handle every type of programming error
investigation with consistent, reliable results.

Our testing philosophy follows Debuggle's educational approach:
- Each test is like a training scenario that covers real-world situations
- Tests are documented with high school-level analogies for easy understanding  
- Comprehensive coverage includes happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions
- Focus on business logic validation rather than implementation details

Test categories mirror real detective work:
1. Basic Investigation Tests (standard error processing)
2. Enhanced Investigation Tests (with context extraction)
3. Specialized Analysis Tests (language detection, tagging, summarization)
4. Error Handling Tests (when investigation tools fail)
5. Integration Tests (multiple components working together)
6. Performance Tests (investigation speed and resource usage)

Coverage Target: 20% ‚Üí 75% (comprehensive business logic coverage)
