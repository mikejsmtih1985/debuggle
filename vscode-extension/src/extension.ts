/**
 * üöÄ VS CODE EXTENSION COMMAND CENTER - The Space Mission Control! üöÄ
 * 
 * Think of this file as the main control room at NASA's mission control center!
 * Just like how mission control coordinates all aspects of a space mission,
 * this extension coordinates all the monitoring and debugging features for Debuggle.
 * 
 * üéØ WHAT THIS MODULE DOES:
 * This is the "mission director" that starts up our VS Code extension and makes
 * sure all the different systems (monitoring, dashboard, commands) work together
 * smoothly to help developers debug their code.
 * 
 * üè¢ THE MISSION CONTROL ANALOGY:
 * - extension.ts: The mission control director who oversees everything
 * - debuggleMonitor: The radar system that tracks errors in real-time
 * - monitoringPanel: The main mission dashboard with all the displays
 * - Commands: Different mission procedures the crew can execute
 * 
 * üîß HOW VS CODE EXTENSIONS WORK:
 * 1. VS Code calls activate() when someone installs/enables our extension
 * 2. We register all our commands (like buttons the user can click)
 * 3. We start up our monitoring systems
 * 4. VS Code calls deactivate() when the extension shuts down
 * 
 * Real-world analogy: This is like the main electrical panel in your house that
 * controls all the different circuits and systems - lights, outlets, heating, etc.

     * 
     * üèÜ HIGH SCHOOL EXPLANATION:
     * Think of this like starting up a complex video game or launching a sophisticated
     * app on your phone. The system needs to:
     * 1. Initialize all the different components
     * 2. Set up all the buttons and menus
     * 3. Connect to external services
     * 4. Be ready for user interaction
     * 
     * The 'context' parameter is like the game's save file - it contains all the
     * settings and resources our extension needs to operate properly.
