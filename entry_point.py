Debuggle Entry Point - The main door into the Debuggle application

Think of this file like the front door of a building - it's where everyone enters
and it decides which room (feature) they should go to.

This file provides two main ways to use Debuggle:
1. CLI mode: Type commands in terminal to analyze error logs directly
2. Server mode: Open a web browser to use Debuggle with a nice interface

Default behavior: If you just run "python entry_point.py", it starts a web server
that you can visit at http://localhost:8000 in your browser

Usage examples:
    python entry_point.py                    # Start web server (easiest way)
    python entry_point.py serve --port 8080  # Start server on different port
    python entry_point.py analyze file.log   # Analyze a log file in terminal
"""

import sys        # System tools (like command line arguments)
import os         # Operating system tools (like checking if files exist)
import argparse   # Command line argument parser (handles --port, --help, etc.)
from pathlib import Path  # Modern way to work with file paths

# directions to Python so it knows where to find our Debuggle modules
